Block User Ads is a lightweight plugin that will allow you to block users from posting ads. 

== Description ==
If you are running a Classipress site you know there can be some users that use your site for posting fake ads.

This plugin will block selected users from posting ads and renewing them also. Users will still be able to login, but won't be able to post any ads.

After you select a user to be blocked from posting ads, the user will be redirected to a new template (page) that you can customize.

You will be able to select an image and top and bottom text with all CSS parameters from size, weight, style...

You can even use variables [home] and [desktop] to create links for user.

There is also an option to add an additional top and bottom text that can be used for commercial ads like Google Ads.
